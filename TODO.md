explain well the gamma and power utility function, with plot charts

expected utility value and optimal Yes/No: some smallest one is marked as Yes
* why each year has a utility value, and optimal or not flag?

obtain realistic equity vs. bond return/risk data

equity/bond correlation: make it dynamic with some distribution

not much sense for the last plot Monte Carlo simulation paths

add a detailed running log html to check if all steps are correct, no surpises
